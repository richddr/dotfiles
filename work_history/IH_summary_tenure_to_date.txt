@cobbr2 @pfarrell following the same pattern used in https://github.com/ConsultingMD/service/pull/85 for our other services (jarvis, rogers, warehouse, stone, frick)

@mike809 

@alexebird this is a temporary workaround, when you come back let's sit down and pair on applying the correct fix. Basically wherever we set the `database_url` for tp it needs to be `postgis` instead of `postgres`. Me and michael tried doing that on `GR/honesty/lib/pancakes/schema.rb:13` but that didn't work...when we ssh'd into the tp machine/image the database url was still saying `postgres`

PR #160: Don't lock materialized views when updating them

Description:
Update to /lib/scenic/adapters/postgres.rb#update_materialized_view

**Before if there were big changes done to a materialized view, when that migration was run on a production environment, it would lock up the materialized view and it would result in end users having a bad experience. This PR addresses this issue by doing the following:**

When updating a materialized view, instead of:
- Dropping the materialized view
- Recreating the materialized view from the latest version

Do the following:
- Create a materialized view from the latest version with a temporary name ("#{materialized_view_name}_temp").
   This includes applying the new indexes contained in the new version.
- Drop the old materialized view
- Rename the newly created temporary view to the original name

I saw that there weren't any specs for `#update_materialized_view` so I did not write any, also this would be hard to test. All existing specs passed locally (`bin/appraisal rake`). You can verify that this works by having a v1 of a view, then on the v2 of it make it really complex (completely different SELECT, indexes) so it takes a good amount of time to run that migration, while the migration is running, connect to the database and query the materialized view and verify that its not locked and you can get results from it (previous version).

Description:
[Tracker #117590531](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/117590531)

@beghbali @timz1290 @glacier @wenever @pfarrell 

This endpoint will use the [accept header for versioning](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape#header), this way we don't need to specify the version in the path (which is pretty cool).

@beghbali [this link you sent](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/306535/resource-representations-and-rest-api-documentation-tools) was pretty good but unfortunately [grape doesn't yet know how to parse](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape/blob/5122b9ad10b5530be533daa614f9434b4ca04018/lib/grape/middleware/versioner/header.rb#L99) the extra arguments to specify which type of content to request. If we're to go with that approach we'd need to do it manually on our end, or monkey patch it

Example: 
`curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.grnds-v1+json' http://localhost:10003/api/physicians?npi=7945031194`

``` json
{

`current_user.first_time_user?` was returning false, because the sign_in_count was already incremented before reaching this point. This bug has probably existed for a while now. Tested on both master and latest rc branch.

Description:
https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/104600758
Followed looker suggestions to clear the warnings which was to remove the listeners or the filter value

**Example Warning**
_A filter value for "cases.created_date" was provided for this element, but that field is listening to the dashboard filter "cohort". The specified filter value will not be used. **Remove either the filter value or the listener for "cases.created_date"**. If you'd like the element to begin with a filter value, consider setting "default_value" on the filter "cohort"._

I removed the ~~listener~~  filter on both cases.

Description:
https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/91561118

'\hfill \break' is a safer way than '\newline' to do a line break in latex. The former did a line break on the specific section where it was called and it did not fill the other part of the line with blank spacing. This was causing the pdf's to not generate in the correct format.

PR #2612: Redelivering the opinion does not generate a new PDF 

Description:
https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/91622834

-The old behavior was that we were only generating the printed opinion pdf the first time the opinion transitioned to a 'delivered' state. If an opinion was then modified then Tim would not bake the new printed opinion pdf because it already had one generated. This fixes that.

[Tracker #158300913](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/158300913)

This should fix all the timeout issues with reverse tp!

The previous query to fetch the Doctor was using unnecessary stuff and was very inefficient. Changed to use `includes` instead of `eager_load`. Using `includes` "smartly" decides what to use under the hood. [See this page for more info.](http://blog.scoutapp.com/articles/2017/01/24/activerecord-includes-vs-joins-vs-preload-vs-eager_load-when-and-where)

Verified this by fetching for many of the doctors that exhibited the timeout behavior from the helpdesk tickets on UAT and saw the request return substantially faster.

@timz1290 

This is yet another one of the bugs found after ripping off DJ and only saving the doctor_selections on the jarvis side if all of the TP request were successful.

Issue at hand here is that before, we were not checking if the network checkbox was actually changed from it's current value, we would just add it. This would generate a request TpCommand to (add/delete doctor_network) and it would fail in some cases because that visits_access network was deleted (replaced with a new doctor_network import that didn't have it) from TP (due to our current way of doing imports, which will be fixed with DNP).

PR #577: [# 142797483] When searching by procedures, doctors who have null quality procedure adjustment are not surfaced

Description:

[Tracker #142797483](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/142797483)

@nfoen in @timz1290's absence, very minor change. This is moving a where clause inside a join one. Issue surfaced when a new import was done from new data provided by Diane which included procedures that didn't have `quality_percentage_adjustment` value and no results surfaced. For that epic it was assumed that all procedures would have a `quality_percentage_adjustment` value. This is mostly a guard on our end.

I can test with @ritadchen

Description:
Corresponding Jarvis PR: https://github.com/ConsultingMD/jarvis/pull/14840
h3. Why

Slack Thread: [https://grandrounds.slack.com/archives/C5B6SJ19B/p1602197080036300|https://grandrounds.slack.com/archives/C5B6SJ19B/p1602197080036300] and [https://grandrounds.slack.com/archives/C5B6SJ19B/p1602124329034000|https://grandrounds.slack.com/archives/C5B6SJ19B/p1602124329034000]

For the Amazon customer, the Aetna vendor currently sends us the carrier-eligibility information in a monthly cadence. Specifically the 12th of each month. This monthly filename has the date in the filename. This date is used by downstream services to determine eligibility. DE on-call is receiving a lot of tickets now dealing with VID data not being available for a member when the issue is that we haven’t received new data and the message we display to them is to check back in 10 whereas in reality it’s probably ~45 days.

This can vendor can send us weekly files but there’s a catch – their weekly delivery pipeline does not support including the date in the filename for whatever reason. If we were to move to this format someone from SE would then need to rename the file everytime we get a new one. This manual work would be a pain and it’s also not escalable. What if instead we could have the retrieval pipeline (rogers currently, loading-dock in the future) automatically do this rename when it retrieves a file? this ticket should scope out that work.

h3. Acceptance Criteria

{noformat}Scenario: 
Given a data source that has flag configured that we need to add the mtime date to the filename when we retrieve the file and copy it to s3
When a new file is detected and the data source has the flag enabled
Then the resulting file copied to s3 has the mtime date in the filename{noformat}

Changes in this ticket:
- `cutoffdate` defined as `2020-11-03`
- `alert_trigger_info` will contain files that are later than the `cutoffdate`
- `alert_trigger_info_historical` will contain files that are older than the `cutoffdate`
- new datasource health status of `yellow` for datasources that only have alerts for historical files
- we're not going to alert on historical files

Removed the previously added logging pieces because:
- wasn't working
- we can query the latest report for this information now

PR #1688: [DF-3371] Log how many alerts we would fire if we didnt have any customer whitelisting

Description:
Our goal is to enable alerting for all customers and move on from the whitelisted customer list that we have right now. In order to do this we’re choosing to only fire an alert if the mtime of the file in question is later than X (x currently being {{2020/11/3}}). For now we want to count and log these to get a sense of how many alerts this would fire.



For all other alerts of files older than the cutoff date, surface them in the report but don’t fire them.

[DF-3387](https://grandrounds.atlassian.net/browse/DF-3387)

Seems like on certain cases the sleep we have (3 seconds after triggering the PD incident) is not enough time for PD API to create the incident on their end. For this I have two options and I propose for the reviewer to look at both commits separately:
- Option 1: https://github.com/ConsultingMD/potluck/commit/4b07e57b4a7ef51344bcd8d881999138cecab8ab accept that this can happen sometimes and only populate these fields on the report if we are able to fetch the incident. This does not guarantee that in the report we will have filled out all the alerting fields. But the incident will eventually be created and so would it's accompanying jira ticket. In this case the SE would then need to specifically check the report to see the `alertTriggerInfo` if the alerts contained affected files

- Option 2: https://github.com/ConsultingMD/potluck/commit/f1417087f481389dea731db2ca36830ae12ecf6b wrap this code with Matt's nifty `WithRetries` and attempt to fetch the incident 3 times with a wait of 3 seconds in between. If incident is found then great. If the incident is not found (after 3 minutes of firing it) then fail loudly. This guarantees that in the report we will have filled out all the PD alerting fields and the accompanying incident/jira ticket will have the `alertTriggerInfo` on it.  Retrying the task should solve it.

In either option we can also bump up the sleep.

thoughts? @vinaygoel @mattforbes-gr

PR #1329: [DATA-299] Duplicate addresses between GR audits and Enclarity

Description:
Two databugs have come in the past week where a member has been confused because there are duplicate addresses for the provider, one added through GR audits and sourced from Enclarity. The addresses appear to be identical, however, the GR audit location will always be OON and the Enclarity location may appear INN creating more confusion. I believe some of this stems from JCurve updates and also Care Team updating a providers addresses which is later updated in Enclarity. 

Example:

!image-20200917-044726.png|width=565,height=498!

Based on this query that compares number of distinct addresses for a physicians to total addresses, this seems to be effecting ~17K physicians. 

{noformat}SELECT npi, count(distinct loc.street_address_line_1) AS count_distinct, count(loc.street_address_line_1) as count_total
  FROM airflow_floyd.canonical__providers prov 
        JOIN airflow_floyd.canonical__provider_locations loc on prov.id=loc.provider_id
  WHERE prov.provider_type=physician
  GROUP BY npi
  HAVING count_distinct < count_total{noformat}

This was with a small file. For good measure I also did it with the latest enclarity dataset as well which was also successfully uploaded:
```
2020-10-01 02:14:32 4197209402 rgarcia/output/enclarity/rgarcia/input/grandrounds_20200928_from_sftp.zip.pgp/0301a682-2b31-4200-81e1-18a983d2a0de
```

Nonetheless I put this change behind a feature flag in the chance it doesn't work in Prod we can quickly disable and process the weekly zelis dataset over with the usual crappier way.

PR #1323: [DATA-312] provider_specialties are missing after enclarity started sending us non_physicians

Description:
*Problem:* 

In June, Enclarity began sending us non-MD data. They created a flag based on the providers speciality and degree information to differentiate between the non-MD and physicians. We started using the flag on 6/17 and since then we dropped 28k physicians (~4% of physician volume) from our specialty table. A quarter of the physicians are Primary Care and 16% of physicians dropped are in Michigan. 

Example providers: 1205120490, 1023019288

In order to fix this, we need to allow Zelis physicians to be assigned to physician specialties in {{canonical.provider_specialties}}.

PR #395: [DATA-236] Data source polling causing error on external SFTP

Description:
Meritain puts an eligibility file on their SFTP and our Data source picks it up. Meritain says theyre receiving the below error from our SFTP process:

“Error status is true, but no error message defined.“

According to [~accountid:557058:94fd4465-dd26-4bb8-8cec-50cd9656fa39]
Looking at logs from the last file delivery (7/28) and it completed successfully with no errors on our end.
07/28/2020 15:40:30.478 -0700 Processing DataSource#30, 
07/28/2020 15:40:30.478 -0700 Finished DataSource#30 in 1533.22 ms

Data source #30
Customer: https://stark.grandrounds.com/admin/customers/69

Latest from Meritain:
Reading from the bottom of the table (oldest) to the top (newest), they connect and initiate a get/pull (transfer ID cc3b84c3-32e3-49d4-a7be-77ae517f7e50 in red). Then, less than a second later, they initiated a second get/pull (transfer ID 88fdc48c-fcad-477d-8206-b104a10fea49 in yellow), while the first transfer is still running, of the same file. This second get/pull request is picked up by the backend node stp01. This causes the first transfer sessions which is reading the file on node stp02 to fail/error out on reading the file (transfer id cc3b84c3-32e3-49d4-a7be-77ae517f7e50 in red). The second transfer then runs to completion successfully (cc3b84c3-32e3-49d4-a7be-77ae517f7e50 in green).
To stop the error, the client must stop issuing multiple get/pull requests on the file.

PR #576: [DF-2743] Copy Bronze PD/Jira clients over to Potluck

Description:
edit (Matt): I took this over to try and push in the pagerduty events component in sooner so we can use it for the lasik SLA alerting. I cut out all of the PD rest API stuff as well as the jira client. I tested out the PD client and triggered an event on my test service and it looks good. After this PR, we'll also need to wire it through in the orchestration layer, and of course replace the parts I cut.

* Vault code implemented in Bronze wont work in Potluck. K8S doesnt use vault yet, they store secrets in s3 in the interim. Need to refactor the code
* The scala JSON client used in Bronze vs Potluck is different. Need to update the code
* The scala version we use in potluck is 2.12 compared to 2.11 for bronze. Can use a more recent version of the http library used in the clients

PR #1213: [DATA-90] Update J-Curve template with new telemedicine questions and augment ingestion flow to load the data

Description:
h3. Why

New fields are highlighted in yellow. Fields that will be sent back empty/no longer validated are in gray. They asked that we keep the same format as the original campaign so there is less of set-up process on their side so the sheet is essentially the same with the addition of the four telemedicine questions.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a8j0DexEjrdX0WO16_jB7ZVg49dwctqgwwM0BcSlNKE/edit?usp=sharing|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a8j0DexEjrdX0WO16_jB7ZVg49dwctqgwwM0BcSlNKE/edit?usp=sharing|smart-link] 

The new telemedicine questions are:

* Does this practice offer virtual office visits to patients? - _Yes/No_ (this will be the telemedicine flag)
* If yes, are virtual care visits restricted to established patients? - Y_es/No_
* If yes, are virtual visits a permanent offering or temporary? - _Yes/No_
* If yes, what is the primary method for virtual care visits? - _Free Text_

*Notes:*

This PR adds support for the ingestion of the new telemedicine j-curve fields into floyd.

Description:
*Why*
Amazon (Pilot) will be onboarded soon with Financial Guidance (FG). In order to support the 270/271 calls via ClearCostHealth (CCH) we need to include the alpha prefix in the parameters we send to CCH for certain carriers (_only Premera for Amazon_).

*Acceptance Criteria*
Scenario: 
*_Given the alpha prefix mapping file_*
*_When one views the file_*
*_Then there is logic that determines the alpha prefix for the Amazon (Pilot) customer_*

*Notes*
Amazon (Pilot) will be rolling out with two carriers: Aetna and Premera. The alpha prefix is  only needed  for the Premera carrier.

* Add the mapping to lib/cch/alpha_prefix_mapping.rb in jarvis

See the following sheet for information regarding which alpha prefix to use: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dZscY7mTPvlxpEI4PbRFpVZnwDCwWzcGM-isN0SHQLI/edit#gid=0|https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dZscY7mTPvlxpEI4PbRFpVZnwDCwWzcGM-isN0SHQLI/edit#gid=0]

Description:
h3. Why

In order to fully automate the mturk pipeline and not be constantly triggering the detect_reverse_tp_and_load which ends up triggering load_canonical, remove this trigger.

detect_reverse_tp_and_load will still be trigger by the weekly zelis or monthly enclarity load. With this way any pending mturk edits will included in that run.

PR #1445: [CDS-6375] Discrepancy between Coverage Server Projection Logic and Data Factory Logic Leads to Loss of Coverage

Description:
There appears to be a discrepancy in some coverage cases between how data factory creates fhir bundles and how coverage server expects the bundles to appear. For example, for ID {{0014w000039733tAAA}}, the FHIR bundle returns 

```
 "resourceType" : "Coverage",
            "subscriber" : {
               "reference" : "Patient/PDID:PatientDescription-9fe2dc7601d316152c92e8f73ad4dc3b3b724ff6cfe1106210863563a8bb9110a46919201dbdcef0c4442ebef492f28d20806dee104f03af1d79eea21d0471f3"
            },
            "grouping" : {
               "group" : "3342073",
               "class" : "PPO",
               "planDisplay" : "HDFC",
               "plan" : "HDFC"
            },
            "id" : "CarrierCoverageId-XXXX,
            "period" : {
               "start" : "2022-01-01",
               "end" : "2041-03-31"
            },
```

Note the end date is 2041-03-31. Stone expects 9999-12-31 as a future active end date, so this may be causing this member’s coverage to not go through coverage server. 

Collaboration between data tools and data services is required to reach resolution.

PR #25: QOL improvement: augment ih-make-branch to support passing in a jira ticket url

Description:
Before:
```
ih-name-branch https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/CDS-6292
``` 
would fail because it expects to only receive the jira issue id. This results in one always having to manually get this jira link when calling this function. This makes it so you don't have to manually update the jira link you get from the jira UI (which is the url and not the issue id).

PR #9855: [uep] multiple active company eligibility records for same person causing Issues with DOD Coverage

Description:
https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/CDS-5944

This addresses the case we were seeing members with SSN's that changed any of their first/last/dob which resulted in uep generating a duplicate ce record for them. In the insert logic we needed to filter out members with SSN when processing the SSN-less join configuration.

Now we correctly generate an update row (and no insert row) when these subscribers change any of first/last/dob

After this change we may still generate a duplicate ce record for the following case:
- a subscriber/dependent changes their ssn (uncommon but still occurs) [affects every uep customer that's not Google]
- an ssn-less dependent changes either of first/last/dob (more common, usually for spouses due to marriage, or updating child names) [only affects Google since all other uep customers don't accept ssn-less dependents)

For both of those remaining cases the hypothesis is that the pipeline should generate a `deactivate` row on the next run of the pipeline (post new dod rds export). I think I've seen this happen already but not fully confident yet.

AT: I ran these changes against Production (snapshot: `lasik-task-1670482604`) and was able to verify that we no longer generate duplicate ce records when:
- a Google member with SSN previously populated changes their SSN and leaves first/last/dob the same.
- a Google member with SSN populated changes any of the following fields: first/last/dob

Existing tests should cover this.

PR #9840: [uep] Crown Castle members with a gr_coverage_end_date of 2023-01-01 are being marked for deactivate in the delta projection

Description:
https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/CDS-6102

NOTE: This was caught before these delta changes were exported to dod-be so none of these (331) members lost coverage.

This typically only happens for EOY eligibility files where a vendor will sometimes send both the last elig file of the year and the first one for 1/1. For the members that will lose coverage at the end of the year (or they don’t show up in the 1/1 file) they have a gr_coverage_end_date different than 9999-12-31 (2023-01-01 for this crown castle example).

UEP treated `!= 9999-12-31` to determine inactive members and didn't make sure that that value is lower than Date.now (which is what this change does). 

AT: ran change locally against Production (task_snapshot = `lasik-task-1670438220`) and confirmed that with this change none of the Crown Castle members that have a valid_until in the delta projection of `2023-01-01` are marked for deactivate 👍🏽 

Production: (Crown Castle is 1433)

PR #9216: [CDS-5757] [UEP] use raw_coverage_with_entity_ids instead of merged_gr_coverage_with_entity_ids

Description:
We need to move off of {{merged_gr_coverage_with_entity_ids}} and instead instead use {{raw_coverage_with_entity_ids}} for various reasons:

* {{merged_gr_coverage_with_entity_ids}} merges the values in a non-deterministic way. This can present itself in false positives in the delta projection.
* {{merged_gr_coverage_with_entity_id}} doesn’t correctly model the coverage world like {{raw_coverage_with_entity_ids}}:
** Consider the following existing escenario: A subscriber/primary and their spouse both work at Google. They are both subscribers and dependents of each other. This means that on the eligibility file there are four rows: two where each person is a subscriber and two where the spouse is a dependent of the subscriber.
*** In {{merged_gr_coverage_with_entity_id}} we only show the two rows (chosen at random)
*** In {{raw_coverage_with_entity_ids}} we show the 4 rows


Implementation details:
We should only produce one row per member. If a member has both a SUB and a DEP row, give preference to the SUB row. If a DEP has multiple rows under different SUBs, give preference to the first SUB when sorting by subscriber_ssn (desc).

Description:

FROM data_factory.carrier_coverage_with_entity_ids:v1
where gr_customer = 'Google' and coverage_term_date is null),
base_row_number_ones as (
select *

second_window as (
select *,
     row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY gr_customer, entity_id ORDER BY gr_filename DESC, gr_filename_date desc) AS final_row_number
 from base_row_number_ones
)
select entity_id, final_row_number, count(*) from second_window where final_row_number = 1 group by entity_id, final_row_number order by count(*) desc limit 10

`_col2` is `count(*)` and they're all 1 👌🏽 . This wasn't the case before and it's why we included ssn/subscriber_ssn in the join conditions to guarantee uniqueness.

This change will also allow the population of the insurance member id of 329 additional members which we weren't populating it before because:
- the ssn was null on the coverage file and not null on the carrier coverage file so the join condition wasn't succeeding

Description:

[CDS-5610](https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/CDS-5610)


Google ssn-less members didn't have their insurance member id populated.

Issue:
Learn something new about Spark everyday. Setting the join conditions via a `Seq` doesn't handle nullsafe join columns. We need to use the uglier join syntax to be able to explicitly use the `<=>` nullsafe operator on the `ssn` join condition. 

I confirmed this is working by running the task against prod and querying snapshot version to confirm that the `insurance_member_id` of an ssn-less dependent is now populated.

The candidate projection currently takes the latest carrier_eligibility of file of that gr_customer to join with. We’ll need to update this logic since:

A gr_customer can have multiple carrier_coverage data_sources configured. Could be:
  - multiple carrier_coverage data_sources for the same carrier but with different expected frequency (weekly, monthly) (Crown Castle)
  - multiple carrier_coverage data_source for different carriers
  - multiple carrier_coverage data_sources, the real one and a fake/test one (even in Production, like Google)
  
To support all possible scenarios above, we need to partition the rows by ccPartitionKeys and order by GrFilename
and GrFilenameDate to select the most recent row of a given partition.

PR #8686: [CDS-5378] Update UEP to use main_merged_coverage and carrier_coverage tables that have entity_ids

Description:
This is to be able to capture the ~30k dependents that have no ssn. These are currently not being included in the delta projection.

[CDS-5378](https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/CDS-5378)

It's best to review this PR commit by commit. What this PR has:

- Switch to use table versions of merged_coverage/carrier_coverage with entity_ids so we're able to get insurance_member_id for dependents with no SSNs and don't have to do the joins ourselves.
- Update delta projection config, define `JoinConfiguration`. This is to support multiple join_key configurations. This was added to support Google's use case where majority of members have SSNs but there's a small % of dependents that won't have SSN.
- Update delta projection config, define `filter_dependents_no_ssn`. Added to support Google whereas dependents with no ssn are considered valid and we should generate CE records for these members. Whereas for Crown Castle this flag is set to true since we expect every member on the eligibility file to have an ssn.
- Update test fixtures to reflect the new configs + use code suggestions from intellij
- Test dependent with no ssn case. Do the uuid calculation (for inserts) downstream
- fix the logic to retrieved the member_id from the carrier_coverage file. I was not filtering by the gr_customer when getting the most recent gr_filename_date. Verified locally that this works now by running the candidate projection with debug logging statements.

Before, when `delta.validUntil.isDefined` is false, meaning that `validUntil` is None, `delta.getValidUntil` equal `0` which baffles my mind.  This then ends up being converted to `1970-01-01`

<img width="1208" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1312796/186790246-21fa7174-d7ed-4d58-b339-7c89544c6efb.png">

The fix is to not do anything if the field is not defined. 

Also taking the opportunity to convert all the values to `Option[T]` so that `message.asJson.deepDropNullValues` actually removed the null fields.

AT: The following is TEST DATA. After this change this is the payload for an `update` row:

    }
  }
}
```
You can see that `valid_until` is not included in the payload when it's not set.

PR #8490: loading-dock-airflow split into own docker image instead of using catalog image

Description:
LD Airflow is currently on version `2.1.4`. Catalog is on version `2.0.1`. Due to this migration disparity we're currently unable to successfully deploy the LD Airflow service. We can either revert back to the catalog version or we can just split these out to into its own container for LD airflow that the CX team can manage and own. This change attempts to do the latter and copies all the files from the `airflow` container (like `airflow-staging` did). This allows the CX team to upgrade the LD airflow at their will and not have Catalog airflow changes affect the LD airflow.

Pilots use checklists to save planes from fiery crashes.  Use this checklist to save your code from a fiery crash in production. If something doesn't apply, please check it anyway to indicate to a reviewer that you considered it.

* [x] Did you write tests?
* [ ] Did you review any API schema changes?
* [x] Is there appropriate documentation (i.e. good docstrings and/or content in `docs/`)?
* [ ] Did you review the [migration checklist](https://doctorondemand.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/492929326/Migration+PR+Approval+Checklist) if the code includes a migration? Did you apply the `Migration` label to this PR?
* [ ] If this is a high risk PR, is the Jira issue marked with the High risk flag?
* [ ] Is the code safe to [deploy](https://potential-train-b6febc47.pages.github.io/guides/feature-flags-guide.html) to production *without* immediate verification? Is the code feature flagged or added to an existing feature flag? Did you add the `feature_flag` label to the associated Jira issue? Did you create the follow on issue to clean up the flag later?

Reviewers can use the [Backend Code Review Guidelines](https://doctorondemand.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/85365403/Backend+Code+Review+Guidelines) to aid the review.

QA:
In this example I take a member and update their employer's name from `Automation Complex Employer Company Group [test] [two]` to `Automation Complex Employer Company Group [test] [two] [three]`. We then see the historical name show up in the coverage history table:

Can probably polish more the `pricing` and `created_at` columns.

Description:
The DoD warehouse currently houses a table called dod.public.dw_callsegment that identifies legacy customer information as well as segment (health plan vs. employer) which via call_segment could be linked to the silver.televisits:v1 table. This would have broad applications to linking non-legacy customers to visit events and begin to support customer reporting and success metric tracking.

PR #6371: [LDF-2422] Walmart auxiliary lookup is a lasik enrichment

Description:
Plan Lookups for Eligibility

* plan mappings (e.g. for Walmart) is an enrichment on raw coverage data
* win: quicker remediation of coverage incidents (no need to re-run canonicalization)

Create a lasik projection that reads in data_factory.internal.main_raw_coverage:v3 and writes to some internal table. This new internal table will become the input for the customer_id_enricher. 

The projection should utilize existing code in bronze [https://github.com/ConsultingMD/bronze/blob/master/claims-spark/src/main/java/com/grandrounds/coverage/CoveragePipeline.java#L833-L852|https://github.com/ConsultingMD/bronze/blob/master/claims-spark/src/main/java/com/grandrounds/coverage/CoveragePipeline.java#L833-L852]

Once this new internal table has been written we can compare the existing  data_factory.internal.main_raw_coverage:v3 table to ensure that the tables are exactly the same.

After this is validated we can delete the method call on the bronze side and change the input to the customer_id_enricher.

PR #446: bump bronze sha

Description:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1312796/142015114-d1dac741-dd61-4496-8fc0-26b93f2e56cc.png)

Sometimes you'll update the bronze sha in LD and a test will fail. The test output is always similar to:
```
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Unexpected exception thrown: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: ClaimLayout not found for: issi
	at org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertDoesNotThrow.createAssertionFailedError(AssertDoesNotThrow.java:83)
	at org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertDoesNotThrow.assertDoesNotThrow(AssertDoesNotThrow.java:76)
	at org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertDoesNotThrow.assertDoesNotThrow(AssertDoesNotThrow.java:59)
```

This is letting us know that there's been a new bronze layout added for which we haven't added a definition to LD yet.

It tells us the type (`ClaimLayout`) so we know which [file](https://github.com/ConsultingMD/loading-dock/tree/master/src/main/java/com/grandrounds/loadingdock/bronze/layouts) to add it to.

The bronze layouts are [here](https://github.com/ConsultingMD/bronze/tree/master/claims-lib/src/main/java/com/grandrounds/layouts).

It also tells us which layout is missing: `issi`. So now we copy [that](https://github.com/ConsultingMD/bronze/blob/master/claims-lib/src/main/java/com/grandrounds/layouts/ClaimLayout.java#L56) layout definition from the bronze file into the [LD](https://github.com/ConsultingMD/loading-dock/blob/master/src/main/java/com/grandrounds/loadingdock/bronze/layouts/ClaimLayout.java) one.

If you have your IDE setup locally you avoid some cycles by running [this](https://github.com/ConsultingMD/loading-dock/blob/master/src/test/java/com/grandrounds/loadingdock/layouts/LayoutsTest.java) particular test locally and making all the necessary changes before committing and pushing to GH.

Description:
* Add a new `character varying` column, `service_id` to the `alerting_subscriber` table. 
** it will capture the PD service id ({{https://grand-rounds.pagerduty.com/service-directory/PWNNWUS}}, service_id would be {{PWNNWUS}}) for that alerting subscriber if there is one.
* Update alerting logic to fire the alert to the owner’s service if they have a service id (Mostly all of SE will have one) otherwise fire to the LD service.

Everyone in SE has their own SE service created in PD so this ticket is to continue supporting this process for them.

Create an event "FileWidthGreaterThanFixedWidthSpec" and emit this poll event when a file is detected with a length greater than the fixedWidthRecordLength in the FixedWidthLengthValidator.

Description:
Update the match logic such that if the data source is not collection, then always assume the single file_spec for it will always match (irregardless of the file_name_pattern matching)

PR #2639: [DF-4113] Bind File Naming Convention Update

Description:
I received notification from Bind that their file naming convention will be changing, effective 9/1/21.

Old file naming convention:
BIND_target_MCLAIMS_prod_YYYYMMDD######.txt.pgp

(note that target could be any customer name)

New file naming convention:
bind_grandrounds_mclaims_prod_date_tgt_000001.txt

(note that tgt will be a 3 letter code for each customer)

I believe we will need to do some DF work to properly ingest the files with the new filenames.

PR #295: [LD-440] implement start_date_for_frequency with tolerances for the expected frequencies to not generate false positive alerts

Description:
    expected-frequency-missed query works via postman
      there are a lot of false positives
      - LD doesnt use any tolerances for the expected_frequency (like potluck does)
          well want to modify start_date_for_frequency to include the tolerance
      - there were a bunch of entries for datasources that need to be disabled/soft deleted
          Ive disabled/soft deleted them

PR #4026: [LD-378] Filename date validator logic fails when there are multiple capturing groups

Description:
The LD logic expects a single capturing group in the filename date pattern regex. However the existing Bronze logic has multiple capturing groups and pulls the date from the appropriate one. We should modify the `filename_date_matchers` json to expect another value `group` which determines the capturing group. This value should be used in the FileNameDateValidator to return the correct matched pattern.

Example JSON:

{noformat}
[
  {
    "pattern": "daily_adt_(\\d{8}).csv",
    "format": "yyyyMMdd",
    "group": 1
  },
  {

PR #4019: [LD-373] Create new column `filename_date_matcher` on data_source 

Description:
This column will be a json array and have data of this form:

{noformat}[
  {
    "pattern": "(.*questdiagnosticsbfw_)(\\d{4}_)(\\d{8})(.*)",
    "format": "MMddyyyy"
  },
  {
    "pattern": ".*_(\\d{8})\\d{6}.*",
    "format": "yyyyMMdd"
  }
]{noformat}

This column will be taking the place of the existing filename_date_pattern and filename_date_format columns (for now while we backfill data over from Bronze in a separate ticket). We will need to update the necessary DTOs in both Loading Dock and Potluck for the new schema. 

In addition, we will need to update the {{FileNameDateValidator}}  validator logic (or rename/deprecate, whatever is easier) in Potluck to use these values instead of filename_date_pattern and filename_date_format. As this is an array, we will need to update the logic to check each matcher and if any of them matches the file can be considered valid. Otherwise it is invalid.

In a subsequent story ([LD-372]) we will backfill this information from Bronze for all data sources. In the meantime, we will manually update this column in the database for the launch of biometric and adt BronzeTypes.

The Airflow scheduler seems to die repeatedly, especially when the number of processing tasks is high.

* change the number of parallel tasks to 20
* does the health check work?
* the Airflow scheduler is notoriously poor. Is it worth just upgrading to Airflow 2.0 rather than patching it?

PR #1649: [DATA-648] zelis:1102 returns results in TP but not in providerSearches GQL query

Description:
The GQL query providerSearches returns 0 results when querying for providers under an insurancePlanSlug that has {{zelis:1102}}, such as [liberty_mutual_uhc_hawaii_ppo|https://stark.uat.grandrounds.com/admin/customers/569464876/provider_directory_mappings]. However, running the same search in TP UAT returns providers.

h3. Steps to reproduce

In Graphql:

Query:

{noformat}query ProviderSearches($input: ProviderSearchesInput!) {
  providerSearches(input: $input) {
    provider {
      displayName
      npi
      uid
      ... on PhysicianType {

      }
      ... on NonPhysicianType {
        gender
      }
      locations {
        addressUid
        streetAddressLine1
        postalCode
      }
    }
  }
}{noformat}

Variables:

{noformat}{
  "input": {

    "insurancePlanSlug": "liberty_mutual_uhc_hawaii_ppo",
    "postalCode": "96720",
    "limit": 5,
    "providerAttributes": {
      "isPracticing": true
    }
  }
}{noformat}



h3. Expected

Returns non-zero provider searches.

h3. Actual

{noformat}{
    "data": {
        "providerSearches": []
    }
}{noformat}

Description:
members who attempted to enroll while [https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/ACT-154|https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/ACT-154|smart-link] was outstanding may have an incorrect DOB on their account.  We need to:

* assess how widespread the problem is
* determine if we can backfill DOB from elig when it differs from the value on the account
* write and test a backfill script
* execute backfill

I thought we had this fixed when we fixed the linked iOS bug but it seems not.  This might stem from flex reg allowing account dob to diverge from enrollment/verificaction field dob.

## JIRA ticket

https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/IAM-129

## What does this PR do?

This PR helps mitigate the damage from member account issues arising from the mass overwriting of member email addresses with auto-generated email address ([hopefully now fixed](https://github.com/ConsultingMD/athena-bridge/pull/1195) at the root cause in athena-bridge).

Changes in Jarvis Auth0Sync

* clean up pre-existing email conflicts before attempting to change an email address in Auth0
* avoid overwriting real emails with autogenerated emails (just in case the underlying problem isn't fully resolved)
* additional safeguards and logging for after_commit event creating/updating Jarvis user
  * Fail and rollbar during account_creation if auth0_user_id param does not point to a real account.
  * check for email conflicts
  * check for account_id conflicts
* abort sync when necessary with more human readable errors (these should be visible in Stark, not sure about The Hub)
* Replace check for autogenerated_email? that didn't always work as expected. The new check has no ambiguity about code path, and is local to the module.

See updated Jira issue comments: https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/IAM-129?focusedCommentId=1725332
Also see: ["Battle Plan" document ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dF1LGwcJfMqDZoHlQEtsYOAhGExSnLcAHgtvGZHpTWI/edit?usp=sharing)

## Relevant context.

The Tech Support team has reported unmanageably high volumes of account-identity linking issues. Notable causes:

* autogenerated emails overwriting valid member emails created during signup (~1700 Auth9 profiles found). This creates multiple problems, not the least of which are inability to login, or for Tech Support to easily provide a solution.
* Over 700k autogenerated Auth0 profiles found, which create account claiming issues when members having autogenerated accounts try to sign up via flex reg.

## Pull Request Guidelines and Best Practices

<i>Nit pick:</i> These should be comments that are marked as "NIT" and should not block merging because they do not break functionality but are nice to have.
<i>Blocking changes:</i> These should be comments that are marked as "Blocking" and may not break functionality but they may break established patterns or coding norms or architectural patterns.

PR #6918: [ACQ-792] Expand how frequently we send Event 1

Description:
We are not seeing the event properties tracked in Meta Ad Manager that we expect for “Event 1”, which is the event we are using to track registration.

The names are intentionally obtuse to abide by Meta’s ad restrictions, and we had originally intended to only send “Event 1” when it was triggered from an fbclid. However, we want to loosen that restriction and send every Event 1 that is fired (even when fbclid is None) in order to confirm that there is a large enough volume of events to be detected via Ad Manager.

I believe we already loosened the restrictions for “Event 2”, so I think it’s worth double checking how that is implemented as a starting point.

Here are the events in Amplitude: [https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/grand-rounds/chart/new/rp5u6pjk|https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/grand-rounds/chart/new/rp5u6pjk|smart-link] 

And here is an example where fbclid and tbd (the two properties we are passing to Meta) are not null: [https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/grand-rounds/chart/new/hqpc84ca|https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/grand-rounds/chart/new/hqpc84ca|smart-link] 

* Note: I think that we care about User Property over Event Property, based on how the Amplitude Connection is set up. I notice that there is an extremely low volume of events where User Property is not null. That is suspicious to me. Here is a chart that compares [Event Property and User Property for Event 1|https://app.amplitude.com/analytics/grand-rounds/chart/new/kvw4zmmc]

For context, this is what the Connection set up looks like 

* !image-20250130-013026.png|width=460,height=550,alt="image-20250130-013026.png"!

Description:
for INC-666 mitigation

Covers the following issue:
```
member1 ->
1. IH account: IH1 -> dod1
2. 2 dod account: dod1, dod2

t1: user logs in at: create migration record with IH1, [dod1] (there was probably a bug that was later fixed here)
t2: user logs in dod app -> trigger merge of dod1 and dod2 -> dod1 is archived and dod2 is the remaining dod account with both dod1 and dod2's data
t3: user logs in DIH/IH app -> tirgger data migration -> at this time, we only find the dod1 in the migration record and use dod1 to do the data migration 


solution
1. find the impacted migration: go through the migration record with only ariched dod user (filer the dod user who has "archived_member_user_of_id") -> 509 members: https://querybook.includedhealth.com/lasik/query_execution/1617322/
2. modify the migraiton record to also included the remaining dod user uuid in the to migrated dod user list -> This PR
3. re-run the data migration

- remove the provision-unified-account* cmds as these were pre-lasso and are no longer relevant
- adds a new cmd to create IH accounts: `./support-tools --jira=work service ais create-account path-to-file.json`

Example:
Given a file `deleteme-rgarcia.csv` with the following contents:
```csv
firstName,lastName,dateOfBirth,email,ss4
"richard20250107-8","garcia20250107-8","1970-01-01","rgarcia20250107-8@grnds.com","0000"

```

First run, creates the accounts:
```
❯ ./main.py --jira=work service ais create-account deleteme-rgarcia.csv /tmp/deleteme-rgarcia-output
WARNING:root:pyiceberg is not installed, cannot interact with Iceberg tables

PR #709: move attempt event after customer/insurance selection, add additional fields

Description:
> Our understanding is that we want the attempt enrollment event to fire when the member selects an employer (so sometime [between View Enrollment Customer Selection](https://www.figma.com/board/b1QzjUUFt67UtbicZnt3Ew/Acquire-Flow-and-Metrics?node-id=532-248&node-type=text&t=DHGIvQg4O1wphlZH-0) and View Enrollment Enrollment Prompt). Is that when it's firing?
On the figma, it looks like it might be firing after we get the member's PII and [also for retail](https://www.figma.com/board/b1QzjUUFt67UtbicZnt3Ew/Acquire-Flow-and-Metrics?node-id=847-304&node-type=text&t=DHGIvQg4O1wphlZH-0), so wanted to confirm
We also want to be able to slice the metric by the type of enrollment a member is attempting -- Employer vs. Insurer, and by client account / population. But [it doesn't look like we are getting the client account id that someone attempted to enroll with on the attempted event](https://querybook.includedhealth.com/lasik/query_execution/1431178/). Could we get that?

This PR does the following:
- moves the attempt event firing to be right after the customer/insurance is selected, instead of firing before calling VerifyCoverageAndEnroll
- populates additional fields on the event:
  - screen: whether it was the customer or insurance screen
  - the `CustomerID` selected (customer/insurance will be the same) (this will be the salescloud account id)
  - the `Alias` of the customer/insurance selected
  - retail: whether the attempt was for retail. If so customerid/alias will be nil

After this is merged/deployed I will update the figma.

PR #1610: if we encounter an RTE issue, still return the pricing config so cost share can use the downtime price if they want to

Description:
The downtime price is contained in the charge table line item. Currently this is only returned if we're able to make a successful RTE call. This change makes sure to return a response that has the pricing config even if we had issues retrieving making the RTE call. 

This way cost-share can decide whether to show the downtime price to the member (instead of retail)

PR #730: increase timeout for gql calls

Description:
similar to https://github.com/ConsultingMD/oneapp-migration/pull/496

Jarvis currently calls coverage, which can take a long time to respond if it needs to make an RTE request for certain payers, so we increase the timeout to 60 seconds.

This then leads to pages about the AIS consumer lag falling behind:

All the join columns already have indexes but a lot of the ones used in the `WHERE` do not. This PR adds those indexes concurrently to not lock the table for the following columns:

From the where clauses, not all columns have indexes. Can add some for the following:
```
doctors_doctor.takes_by_provider_appointments
doctors_doctorstatelicense.expiration_date
doctors_doctorstatelicense.issue_date
doctors_doctorstatelicense.license_number
doctors_primarycareprovider.end_datetime
users_doduser.is_active
```

This should hopefully increase the performance bottleneck.

PR #12411: [DATASERV-9361] log price observations to eventjournal

Description:
https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/DATASERV-9361
This PR adds the following:

- Adds `payer_downtime_detected` and `payer_downtime_member_eligible` flags to the RTELog model. This should help with reporting for smart downtime. Not sure if adding it here automatically gets this exported to lasik?
- Adds a `log_preview_price_event` helper method to be used to record preview prices

Note:
The `get_segments_and_pricing` endpoint is called 6 times in the get care MX flow, so there will be multiple logs per member going through the Get Care flow. Grabbing distinct records per member per day per price using a group by & a join in sql should help work around this limitation.

example:
```sql
select CAST(called_at as DATE) as called_at_day, member_id, price from <this eventjournal table> 
group by CAST(called_at as DATE), member_id, price
```

Currently we're only logging the prices:
- [x] cases where RTE is used and RTE returned successfully. (Most common case)
- [x] cases where RTE is used and RTE returned an error
- [x] cases where RTE is not used

Things remaining:
- [x] Flag added to LD: [rte-emit-member-preview-price-events](https://app.launchdarkly.com/projects/dod-backend/flags/rte-emit-member-preview-price-events?env=production&selected-env=production)
- [x] Merge https://github.com/ConsultingMD/potluck/pull/18163 which has additional fields added to the proto
- [x] Bump eventjournal in this branch
- [x] Uncomment code for the additional fields in `log_preview_price_event()`

PR #1128: [DATASERV-9127] Handle nil timestamp in predicates

Description:
The issue was caused by this rollbar: [https://app.rollbar.com/a/Grandrounds/fix/item/coverage-server/2144|https://app.rollbar.com/a/Grandrounds/fix/item/coverage-server/2144|smart-link] 

The predicate evaluation failed because in the predicate expression: 

{noformat}plan != V300 and DATE_DIFF(day, termination_date, current_timestamp()) >= 0{noformat}

termination_date could be null from member’s eligibility fields and coverage-server would throw error when parsing empty string to timestamp.

This is also a followup ticket for [https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/DATASERV-9012|https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/DATASERV-9012|smart-link] 

The original predicate expression was 

{noformat}(plan = V300 and termination_date IS NULL) OR (plan = V300 and DATE_DIFF(day, termination_date, current_timestamp() ) >= 0){noformat}

And this will not work because this expression will fail predicate evaluation due to the same reason, and we suggested SE to break the original expression into 2 so that member can be matched to one of the following:

{noformat}predicate1: plan = V300 and termination_date IS NULL
predicate2: plan = V300 and DATE_DIFF(day, termination_date, current_timestamp()) >= 0{noformat}

However, in this case, when a member has NULL {{termination_date}} eligibility field, they will be matched to first predicated and fail the second one.

I’m not sure if there is a way to set the predicate expression to set NULL date value. If not, probably we need to update predicate in coverage-server to properly handle null date.

Description:
[DATASERV-9127](https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/DATASERV-9127)

On the potluck side this is just adding a new test case to explicitly test this. The scala code was already correctly doing the evaluation. The coverage-server PR includes the code change to replicate the logic.

confirmed this should fix it by testing in a debug pod:
```
params = ActionController::Parameters.new({created_at: {gte: "1710436092"}, page: 1})
index_params =  params.permit(:page, created_at: [:gte])
audit_events = AuditEvent.paginate(page: index_params[:page], per_page: 200).order(created_at: :asc).includes(:audit_event_attribute_changes).where('extract(epoch from created_at) >= ?', index_params[:created_at][:gte])
first_page = audit_events.page(1)
aer = AuditEventsRepresenter.new(first_page)
aer.to_json(user_options: {params: index_params})
```
We can see that it's populated correctly now:

I can additionally remove the employer for all these affected members via:
```sql
UPDATE members_member
SET employer_id = null, eligibility_record_id = null
FROM organizations_companygroup, organizations_company
WHERE members_member.employer_id = organizations_companygroup.id
        AND organizations_company.id = organizations_companygroup.company_id
        AND organizations_companygroup.use_271_for_eligibility is false
        AND organizations_companygroup.name NOT ilike '%inactive%'
        AND members_member.employer_id is NOT null
        AND members_member.eligibility_record_id is NULL ;
```

Then each member can re-add their employer and if a CE record is found it should fix the issue and if no CE record is found it should return the expected appropriate error msg.

PR #16254: [DTOOLS-2321] 1:N datasources do not term coverage appropriately - UEP fix

Description:
https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/DTOOLS-2321

Issue: will be using `PDID:PatientDescription-34c6bedd044247e5d0fa31803c8c175a3e90e3467ec5ee4fbbed77799d3cd56afb28461ce4946ac7e1327bddbdb0cde2cf3ff7c062cc570352d186b8cc472a49` as the [example member](https://querybook.includedhealth.com/lasik/query_execution/1022731/) to surface the issue:

1. [In the candidate projection](https://querybook.includedhealth.com/lasik/query_execution/1022696/), they have two rows, both showing a `valid_until` value of `9999-12-31`. The row where their `insurance_carrier` is `Independence` is their latest current one and should be the only active row. The other row corresponds to their previous years selections in which they were part of a different company_group.
2. We see the [same](https://querybook.includedhealth.com/lasik/query_execution/1023999/) in `raw_coverage_with_entity_ids`. Multiple rows with a `gr_next_filename_date` of `9999-12-31` denoting active coverage. This is expected since the original fix was never done to these ER tables, it was only done in the [fhirizer](https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/DTOOLS-2321?focusedCommentId=1334775)
3. Without the fix this presents itself in the delta projection as [two](https://querybook.includedhealth.com/lasik/query_execution/1022758/) `update` rows. One for each company_group.
4. I haven't confirmed if it's a race condition but even though we have these two `update` rows, on the [dod-be side](https://poc.doctorondemand.com/ccadmin/eligibility/companyeligibility/9224231/change/), it's correctly applying the new/correct delta as CE record is associated to the right company group and has the right values. I think we have some logic somewhere that applies the update based on the newest `cliend_record_date` (which the correct row has a value of `2024-01-01` whereas the previous year's row has a value of `2023-12-28`. Given my earlier statement and the fact that I haven't seen a case where the last applied change is the old one, this seems like a cosmetic issue currently in that it's generating an extra delta `update` row. To clarify, I think the issue is a cosmetic one when it's members switching from company groups. If they're on the same company group but have different values for insurance_member_id then those would've have seen the issue (and the bandaid fix of updating the grace period should have fixed the majority of those, as evidence [here](https://ih-epdd.slack.com/archives/C063E06SX3R/p1704464849042989?thread_ts=1704388378.021529&cid=C063E06SX3R))
5. With the fix in this PR, the previous years row would then NOT have a `valid_until` of `9999-12-31`, and instead be `max(gr_filename_date)-1 day` which for this member would be `2024-01-03`
6. Ran locally agaisn't production verified so after querying the snapshot `lasik_task_1704487073` generated:

Before:

Caveat: the `valid_until` on the old record can fluctuate if we receive a new (and correct) elig file while the old population row is still showing up as active (due to the grace period)

PR #16226: [UNCO-905] support different gr_customer name across eligibility & carrier coverage

Description:
https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/UNCO-905

For 1:N Datasources, we assign a datasource slug that is different than the gr_customer name. In UEP, we use gr_customer name to join across raw_coverage and carrier_coverage

coverage = carrier_coverage
For Zendesk:

`zendesk-workday` = `Zendesk (pNav/UC/BH)`

For lululemon:

`lululemon-empyrean` = `lululemon`

Tests updated to cover this edge case.

PR #11505: [DATASERV-8024] add additional logging for #matches_current_coverage()

Description:
We are getting an enormous number of eligibility events for members in the unified app, both “Eligibility Events” and “Insurance Events” where applicable.

In testing on UAT, I’m finding that every single time I go through intake (at whatever step provisioning would be) the member is deregistered then re-registered.

In some cases I think this is causing problems, but in others, it just seems very strange and I would imaging causing extra delays and things in CCAdmin are getting unruly. Here’s an example from a brand new account creation on UAT. 

I think this is interfering with the PCP choice code and causing something strange to happen that won’t allow a new PCP assignment to stick, but I’ve filed that issue separately with [ CENC-1678 |https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/CENC-1678]

I’m curious for manual insurance entry if it would wipe out the insurance credentials every time or not as well (which was happening earlier on). Now insurance is auto-applying on these accounts, however, which wasn’t really the intention for this company setup.

Correct me if I’m thinking about this wrong, but I would think there would be an eligibility check at this point, but no change to the benefit if nothing was wrong with it in the first place.

PR #4773: [DATASERV-7448] Switch FHIR Server over to a standalone Salesforce user

Description:
As part of finishing up the work from [https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/INC-96|https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/INC-96|smart-link], we were asked to [switch to a more secure way of authenticating against Salesforce|https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/DATASERV-4034]. We’ve done that for all of our services except FHIR Server. Unfortunately, the library we use to talk to Salesforce from FHIR Server doesn’t support JWT auth, and never will because it’s been abandoned. The cost of changing that is quite high because we’d have to find a new library or write one ourselves, few people on the team understand Scala or Java, FHIR Server is poorly tested, and it’s at the center of many product flows. Furthermore, we intend to break up FHIR Server into Scala based services this year.

Aside from being a security problem, there’s also a debugging problem which is that every time CTX wants to debug something with FHIR Server, they have to reset the password, which can then break FHIR Server.

To mitigate these risks in the short term, we can just create a standalone Salesforce user for FHIR Server. Instructions from Andy Ray:

To make a new integration-y type user:

Do these instructions first in UAT, then in Production.

* Make a new user in production where the email address is a shared alias your whole team has access to. For example, the CTX team uses [care-platform-eng healthcloud-api-01@grandrounds.com|mailto:care-platform-eng healthcloud-api-01@grandrounds.com] (don’t use this, use one your team has access to) (use the same email for UAT and production).
* Make the username something like integration_fhir_user@includedhealth.com.hc (the .hc stands for healthcloud)
* Give the new user the “integration user” profile (which is what gives it access to all data in the system)
* Log in as this new FHIR integration user, set the password to something, put that password (and new username) in parameter store, and deploy the fhir server using it.

PR #343: update authz 

Description:
This pull request introduces several changes to enhance authorization handling in the GraphQL resolvers of the `app/handler/graph/schema.resolvers.go` file. The primary updates involve adding checks to ensure proper authorization for specific endpoints and recording authorization checks where sensitive data is not involved.

### Authorization Enhancements:

* **Added authorization recording for resolvers without PII**:
  - Updated the `FirstEnrollmentStep`, `EnrollmentPrompt`, and `EnrollmentVerificationFields` resolvers to record that authorization was checked, as these requests do not involve Personally Identifiable Information (PII). (`[[1]](diffhunk://#diff-832a69bbb7a7bbd4f6e7a75f856fc053b58b35b5148edf5df8eab447af4c47e2R39-R40)`, `[[2]](diffhunk://#diff-832a69bbb7a7bbd4f6e7a75f856fc053b58b35b5148edf5df8eab447af4c47e2R56-R57)`, `[[3]](diffhunk://#diff-832a69bbb7a7bbd4f6e7a75f856fc053b58b35b5148edf5df8eab447af4c47e2R73-R74)`)

* **Implemented strict authorization checks for service-specific endpoints**:
  - Added authorization checks to the `CreateOrClaimAccount` and `VerifyCoverageAndEnroll` mutation resolvers to ensure these endpoints are only accessible by specific services (`mx-ui-workflows`, `wizard`). (`[[1]](diffhunk://#diff-832a69bbb7a7bbd4f6e7a75f856fc053b58b35b5148edf5df8eab447af4c47e2R97-R101)`, `[[2]](diffhunk://#diff-832a69bbb7a7bbd4f6e7a75f856fc053b58b35b5148edf5df8eab447af4c47e2R148-R152)`)

PR #763: update authz check

Description:
This pull request updates the `account_info.go` file in the `package graph` to improve authorization checks and streamline imports. The changes replace a deprecated authorization method with a more robust approach and refine the list of imported packages.

### Authorization Improvements:
* Replaced `http.TokenIsMachine(ctx)` with `authz.Check(ctx, authz.AssertCallerIsOtherService())` to enhance authorization logic. This ensures that the caller is verified as another service using a more modern and reliable method.

### Import Refinements:
* Removed the unused `github.com/ConsultingMD/go-common/http` package and added the `github.com/ConsultingMD/go-common/app/auth/authz` package to align with the updated authorization logic.

The most notable changes include replacing the `http.TokenIsMachine` check with a more robust authorization mechanism using `authz.Check`, and updating the import statements to reflect this new dependency.

### Authorization improvements:
* Replaced the `http.TokenIsMachine` check with `authz.Check` to enforce service-to-service authorization using `authz.AssertCallerIsOtherService`. This change enhances security by ensuring proper validation of machine tokens.

### Import updates:
* Added the `auth/authz` package to the import statements and removed the `http` package, aligning with the new authorization approach.

PR #832: update authz

Description:
This pull request introduces updates to the authentication logic in the `schema.resolvers.go` file and upgrades dependencies in `go.mod`. The authentication changes replace token-based checks with a more robust role-based authorization mechanism, while the dependency updates improve compatibility and incorporate newer versions of libraries.

### Authentication Updates
* **Enhanced Authorization Logic**: Replaced token-based checks (`http.TokenIsUser` and `http.TokenIsMachine`) with role-based authorization using `authz.Check`. This ensures better control over access by asserting caller roles (`AssertCallerIsOtherService`, `AssertCallerIsMember`) and combining them with logical operators (`authz.Or`).

### Dependency Updates
* **Go Version Upgrade**: Updated Go version from `1.23.8` to `1.24.2` and toolchain from `go1.23.9` to `go1.24.4`.
* **Library Updates**: Upgraded multiple dependencies in `go.mod`, including `github.com/ConsultingMD/go-common` (v1.163.0 → v1.166.0), `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` (v1.35.0 → v1.36.0), and `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` (v9.7.3 → v9.10.0), among others, for improved functionality and compatibility.

PR #949: augment CreateAccount mutation to call getPersonByPII to find existing accounts before creating a new account

Description:
Related: https://github.com/ConsultingMD/oneapp-migration/pull/760

This pull request introduces several enhancements and updates across multiple files, focusing on adding new features, improving account search capabilities, and updating the GraphQL schema. Key changes include the addition of a new method for searching persons by Personally Identifiable Information (PII), updates to the GraphQL schema to streamline data structures, and the introduction of feature flags for new search functionalities.

### Enhancements to Account Search:

* Added a new method `GetPersonByPII` to the `Gateway` interface in `app/gateway/janus/gateway.go`, allowing searches for persons using PII. This includes the implementation of the method and integration with the GraphQL client. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a538745dc45114fc673a685d0a061779a02862976f2bfa14a357882a5a324fbdR81-R86) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-a538745dc45114fc673a685d0a061779a02862976f2bfa14a357882a5a324fbdR156-R172)
* Introduced feature flags `SearchClaimableAccountByPhone` and `SearchExistingAccountsByPII` in `app/service/claimaccount/searcher.go` to enable conditional execution of new search functionalities. (F300245cL21R21, [app/service/claimaccount/searcher.goR64-R66](diffhunk://#diff-6ebe4c9db2df444a97d88c49507402814a9c753228bab17ca3542c4ba8287e0eR64-R66))
* Implemented the `findExistingAccountsFromPII` method in `app/service/claimaccount/searcher.go` to search for existing accounts using PII with configurable filters.

### GraphQL Schema Updates:

* Replaced `MedicalDegreeInput` with `MedicalDegree` in various schema types to simplify the data structure. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-e0766daf0d36897e073188a61a8160ca02a4beffe98b4a8f42fc170947d40749L7603-R7603) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-e0766daf0d36897e073188a61a8160ca02a4beffe98b4a8f42fc170947d40749L16028-R16032)
* Added a new field `panelType` to the `ExpertPanelInfo` type to provide additional metadata about expert panels.
* Consolidated and updated mutation inputs, such as replacing `UpdateExpertPractitionerDemographicInfoInput` with `UpdateExpertPractitionerPanelMembershipsInput` and simplifying the case rate update input. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-e0766daf0d36897e073188a61a8160ca02a4beffe98b4a8f42fc170947d40749L17925-R17935) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-e0766daf0d36897e073188a61a8160ca02a4beffe98b4a8f42fc170947d40749L30588-L30649)

### Telemetry and Logging Improvements:

* Added telemetry logs to track errors and behaviors in the new `findExistingAccountsFromPII` method and other related functionalities.
* Updated error handling for `GetPersonByPII` to log specific cases, such as no matches or multiple matches, for better debugging.

### GraphQL Query Addition:

* Introduced a new query `GetPersonByPII` in `app/gateway/janus/query/getPersonByPII.graphql` to support the new PII-based search functionality.

### Codebase Maintenance:

* Refactored comments and improved readability in the `findUnreliableResult` method in `app/service/claimaccount/searcher.go`.

PR #252: misc refactors to account creation cmds + adding cmd to generate hash from member demographics

Description:
This pull request introduces several enhancements and new features to the `ais` and `hub` services, focusing on improved account creation, demographic hashing, and handling of primary account fields. It also includes updates to GraphQL queries and command-line interfaces for better flexibility and usability. Below are the most significant changes grouped by theme.

### Enhancements to Account Handling
* Added support for handling primary account fields in both `create_account` and `get_account_ids` methods by introducing a `primaries` flag. This affects the logic for processing input/output CSVs and field prefixes. (`lib/service/ais.py`, `lib/service/hub.py`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a218dbae248f86e7e3c904b8fb82bdbe9dabc106e81bff11e0b63f8f068ab4b0R134-R167) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-cb7fe3ef43b3bc5893f15a942c124bba0649eebf11628fc5ffb95e56700c6465L47-R64)
* Updated the `build_mutation_variables` method to dynamically handle optional fields and validate required fields, returning an `invalid_row` flag for incomplete data. (`lib/service/ais.py`)

### New Features
* Introduced a `generate_demographic_hash` method to create a SHA256 hash from normalized demographic data (first name, last name, DOB, and SSN last 4 digits). This method is also exposed via a new CLI command. (`lib/service/ais.py`, `tool/service.py`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a218dbae248f86e7e3c904b8fb82bdbe9dabc106e81bff11e0b63f8f068ab4b0R96-R124) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-4e3aca18cafec57820f7cd50f3410267afa253aec13c8ddb7b7181bd7fb160bfR114-R128)
* Added CLI options for specifying the `primaries` flag in `create_account` and `get_account_ids` commands, improving command-line flexibility. (`tool/service.py`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-4e3aca18cafec57820f7cd50f3410267afa253aec13c8ddb7b7181bd7fb160bfR114-R128) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-4e3aca18cafec57820f7cd50f3410267afa253aec13c8ddb7b7181bd7fb160bfR1092-R1096)

### GraphQL Query Updates
* Extended GraphQL queries to include additional fields such as `phone` for accounts and `firstName`/`lastName` for relationships. (`lib/service/ais.py`, `lib/service/relationship.py`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a218dbae248f86e7e3c904b8fb82bdbe9dabc106e81bff11e0b63f8f068ab4b0R32) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-5e97f4de049f0892c23f0a1ddf87bc3ef1051811f70bc49528092d1aa5fcc455R14-R20)

### Minor Improvements
* Refactored the `create_account` method to handle account existence checks more robustly by introducing a constant for the `ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS` status. (`lib/service/ais.py`)
* Adjusted the default value for the `provenances` option in the `relationship` command to an empty list for better flexibility. (`tool/service.py`)

PR #944: fix blocked-demographics-list-json FF declaration

Description:
This pull request introduces changes to enhance the handling of blocked demographics in account creation, refactor feature flag usage, and improve test coverage. The most significant updates include replacing string-based feature flags with JSON-based ones, adding a utility function for parsing blocked demographics, and updating the test suite to align with these changes.

### Enhancements to blocked demographics handling:
* Replaced `BlockedDemographicsList` feature flag type from `StringFeatureFlagger` to `JSONFeatureFlagger` in `protostoreRepository` and updated its usage to parse JSON directly into a slice of strings. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fL97-R101) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fL127-R131)
* Added a new method `getBlockedDemographicsList` to encapsulate the logic for parsing the blocked demographics list from the feature flag, improving code readability and error handling. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository.goR674-R683](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR674-R683))

### Refactoring feature flag usage:
* Refactored `checkAndBlockDemographics` to use the new `getBlockedDemographicsList` method, removing inline JSON parsing logic and improving error handling. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository.goL680-R695](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fL680-R695))
* Added telemetry logging to provide better insights into the generated demographic hashes during account creation. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository.goR721-R722](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR721-R722))

### Test suite improvements:
* Updated `ProtostoreRepositoryConfig` in tests to use a `[]string` type for `BlockedDemographicsList` instead of a JSON string, aligning with the new implementation. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.goL70-R71](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96L70-R71))
* Enhanced the mock feature flag implementation to populate target structs with blocked demographics data, ensuring test flexibility and accuracy. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.goL85-R100](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96L85-R100))
* Modified test cases to reflect the new feature flag structure and removed tests for invalid JSON handling, as the new implementation no longer requires manual JSON parsing. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.go`, [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96L1382-R1397) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96L1420-R1435) [[3]](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96L1438-R1462)

PR #943: [ACQ-1251] add support to block account creation based on specific demographic data

Description:
Ticket: https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/ACQ-1251

This pull request introduces a new feature to block account creation based on demographic data, along with supporting utility methods, feature flags, and comprehensive tests. The most important changes include adding a demographic hash-based blocking mechanism, introducing new feature flags, implementing a utility for generating demographic hashes, and expanding test coverage.

### New Feature: Demographic-Based Account Blocking
* Added `checkAndBlockDemographics` method to `protostoreRepository` to block account creation if demographic data matches a restricted hash, controlled by a feature flag. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository.goR670-R737](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR670-R737))
* Introduced a new error type `ErrAccountCreationBlockedDemographics` to signal blocked account creation attempts. (`app/repository/errors.go`, [app/repository/errors.goR42-R43](diffhunk://#diff-00604b0ead13b76933d158e4c6f97ec68aca3ed67137e0ab2c39fa772f9da4ddR42-R43))

### Feature Flags and Configuration
* Added feature flags `enable-demographic-based-account-blocking` and `blocked-demographics-list-json` for enabling the blocking mechanism and defining restricted hashes. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository.goR49-R50](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR49-R50))
* Updated `protostoreRepository` to fetch these feature flags during initialization. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR96-R97) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR126-R127)

### Utility Method for Demographic Hashing
* Added `GenerateDemographicHash` utility to create SHA256 hashes from normalized demographic data for comparison against the restricted list. (`app/utils/demographic_hasher.go`, [app/utils/demographic_hasher.goR1-R53](diffhunk://#diff-ae999600e052be635aa2711c139f0ff13f3ae1b09b75dc36ab625cda7c785e1aR1-R53))

### Test Coverage
* Added unit tests for `checkAndBlockDemographics` and integration tests for account creation scenarios with demographic blocking enabled or disabled. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.goR1364-R1584](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96R1364-R1584))
* Extended the test suite configuration to include new feature flags. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.go`, [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96R69-R70) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96R84-R85)

### Dependency Updates

PR #61: [IAM-441] [Acquire] - Implement DIH branding in relevant screens

Description:
This pull request introduces a significant enhancement to the application's handling of the `isDih` state, which determines whether the app is in "Doctor on Demand" mode. The changes focus on improving state management, ensuring consistency across server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR), and integrating the `isDih` state into various components. The most important changes are grouped into state management, component updates, and utility improvements.

### State Management Enhancements:
* Added a new `AppContext` in `src/shared/contexts/AppContext.tsx` to provide a centralized context for managing the `isDih` state across the application. The context includes methods to initialize, update, and persist the state using URL parameters and `localStorage`.
* Updated `pages/_app.tsx` to wrap the application in the `AppProvider` context and added logic to handle SSR and CSR scenarios for determining the `isDih` state.

### Component Updates:
* Modified `Navbar` in `src/shared/components/navbar.tsx` to dynamically select the appropriate logo based on the `isDih` state, with fallback mechanisms to handle missing context or URL parameters. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-959399c769cbb04bcd8fdc3c84bb1ca61ba03a0ac6c0e0d7b58c34ba7accb11fL1-L7) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-959399c769cbb04bcd8fdc3c84bb1ca61ba03a0ac6c0e0d7b58c34ba7accb11fL17-R63) [[3]](diffhunk://#diff-959399c769cbb04bcd8fdc3c84bb1ca61ba03a0ac6c0e0d7b58c34ba7accb11fL29-R73)
* Updated `pages/login.tsx` to use the `useAppContext` hook for accessing and updating the `isDih` state, ensuring consistency between URL parameters and context. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-efe206089575e5aa92a4bacded0c0c25b4ef6b11199e0d8620eecd1d65b66f50R22) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-efe206089575e5aa92a4bacded0c0c25b4ef6b11199e0d8620eecd1d65b66f50R35-R64)

### Utility Improvements:
* Enhanced `getAmplitudeEventProperties` in `src/lib/services/ampli/utils.ts` to accept an optional `contextOrAppParamIsDih` parameter, allowing it to prioritize context or URL parameters when determining the `isDih` state.
* Updated `useFlow` in `src/shared/hooks/useFlow.ts` to preserve the `app` parameter during flow creation, ensuring that the `isDih` state is consistently propagated during navigation.

PR #7572: [ACQ-1277] [web] Remove authzilla FF

Description:
Per Slack thread: https://ih-epdd.slack.com/archives/C07UYHBAJ7M/p1746464456102269

This pull request simplifies the authentication logic in the `MxApp` component by removing the `AuthzillaVsAuth0Wrapper` and replacing it with a direct implementation using the `Auth0Provider`. Additionally, it removes unused imports and feature flags related to the deprecated `Authzilla` functionality.

### Authentication Refactor:
* Removed the `AuthzillaVsAuth0Wrapper` component and replaced it with a direct implementation of `Auth0Provider` in the `MxApp` component. This change simplifies the code and removes reliance on the `LaunchDarkly` feature flag for determining the authentication tenant. (`[[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a9827ce1be32c607c948881a89b99c592f752898f9c49e0dea0b7199eb151029L68-L138)`, `[[2]](diffhunk://#diff-a9827ce1be32c607c948881a89b99c592f752898f9c49e0dea0b7199eb151029R138-R148)`, `[[3]](diffhunk://#diff-a9827ce1be32c607c948881a89b99c592f752898f9c49e0dea0b7199eb151029L225-L230)`, `[[4]](diffhunk://#diff-a9827ce1be32c607c948881a89b99c592f752898f9c49e0dea0b7199eb151029L253-R201)`)

### Cleanup of Unused Code:
* Removed the `useAuthzillaTenant` feature flag from the `FeatureFlag` enum in `components/shared/featureFlags.ts`. (`[components/shared/featureFlags.tsL209](diffhunk://#diff-6f9cb4961c7a6c42a700e4e50323bbfb7dba6ceb11ee2f0ae7087467a6053fe6L209)`)

* Removed the `isDomainGrandrounds` state and its associated logic from `MxApp`, as it is no longer needed after the refactor. (`[pages/_app.tsxL151](diffhunk://#diff-a9827ce1be32c607c948881a89b99c592f752898f9c49e0dea0b7199eb151029L151)`)

Mitigation for [INC-730](https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/INC-730)

This pull request introduces several significant changes to the account enrollment handling and related functionality. The main updates include adding a feature flag to disable patient creation for auto-generated accounts, enhancing the account enrollment handler to respect this flag, and updating the corresponding tests to cover new scenarios.

### Enhancements to Account Enrollment Handling:

* **Feature Flag Implementation**:
  * Added a new feature flag `DisablePatientCreationForAutoGeneratedAccountEnrollmentEvent` to control whether patient creation should be disabled for auto-generated accounts (`app/model/feature_flags.go`, `app/model/module.go`). [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-f8226ebe6611e912f914bfb12ced8a3e93bc2db1a1b3b20540496b5240195449R110-R118) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-cb8ef8fae6e81e8d5d2e419e11f30bd75d064187ce80592c4df077889bd5ec0cR24)

* **Account Enrollment Handler Updates**:
  * Introduced a new method `shouldIgnore` to determine if an account enrollment event should be ignored based on the account's email, mitigating duplicate account issues (`app/handler/event/account_enrollment.go`).
  * Updated the `Handle` method to use this new logic and added the feature flag check (`app/handler/event/account_enrollment.go`).

* **Service Enhancements**:
  * Added a `GetAccount` method to the enrollment service to retrieve account details (`app/service/enrollment/service.go`).
  * Updated the service initialization to include the account gateway (`app/service/enrollment/service.go`). [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-ae9f22e2c6dd3ce0700737bd9acd83c23b50a159f138ec55fdd1cc9b3c0cb66eR32-R53) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-ae9f22e2c6dd3ce0700737bd9acd83c23b50a159f138ec55fdd1cc9b3c0cb66eR9-R13)

### Test Coverage Improvements:

* **New Test Cases**:
  * Added test cases to cover scenarios where the account is auto-generated and should be ignored during enrollment processing (`app/handler/event/account_enrollment_test.go`). [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-090f1e7e1a6bdfa0b65ec7df9ba2dc8991bba971866e80570e3936c779415d9cR38-R88) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-090f1e7e1a6bdfa0b65ec7df9ba2dc8991bba971866e80570e3936c779415d9cR97-R120)

### Miscellaneous Fixes and Improvements:

* **Typo Fix**:
  * Corrected a typo in the log message from "skippng" to "skipping" (`app/handler/event/account_change.go`).

* **Imports and Package Updates**:
  * Organized imports and added missing dependencies in various files (`app/handler/event/account_enrollment.go`, `app/service/enrollment/module.go`, `app/service/enrollment/service.go`). [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a828da04c2b2d197c9085d332f8abe823431532c3bdd71112648ff0ce26bb216R5-R22) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-62077ad32d1bc6666be3b62c9a04333e2d55836f3ea2b21a7af47f66390f415cL3-R5) [[3]](diffhunk://#diff-ae9f22e2c6dd3ce0700737bd9acd83c23b50a159f138ec55fdd1cc9b3c0cb66eR9-R13)
  * Added a placeholder package for mocks in the diagnostics service (`app/service/diagnostics/mocks/package.go`).

These changes collectively improve the robustness of the account enrollment process by addressing potential issues with auto-generated accounts and enhancing the test coverage to ensure reliability.

PR #343: update authz 

Description:
This pull request introduces several changes to enhance authorization handling in the GraphQL resolvers of the `app/handler/graph/schema.resolvers.go` file. The primary updates involve adding checks to ensure proper authorization for specific endpoints and recording authorization checks where sensitive data is not involved.

### Authorization Enhancements:

* **Added authorization recording for resolvers without PII**:
  - Updated the `FirstEnrollmentStep`, `EnrollmentPrompt`, and `EnrollmentVerificationFields` resolvers to record that authorization was checked, as these requests do not involve Personally Identifiable Information (PII). (`[[1]](diffhunk://#diff-832a69bbb7a7bbd4f6e7a75f856fc053b58b35b5148edf5df8eab447af4c47e2R39-R40)`, `[[2]](diffhunk://#diff-832a69bbb7a7bbd4f6e7a75f856fc053b58b35b5148edf5df8eab447af4c47e2R56-R57)`, `[[3]](diffhunk://#diff-832a69bbb7a7bbd4f6e7a75f856fc053b58b35b5148edf5df8eab447af4c47e2R73-R74)`)

* **Implemented strict authorization checks for service-specific endpoints**:
  - Added authorization checks to the `CreateOrClaimAccount` and `VerifyCoverageAndEnroll` mutation resolvers to ensure these endpoints are only accessible by specific services (`mx-ui-workflows`, `wizard`). (`[[1]](diffhunk://#diff-832a69bbb7a7bbd4f6e7a75f856fc053b58b35b5148edf5df8eab447af4c47e2R97-R101)`, `[[2]](diffhunk://#diff-832a69bbb7a7bbd4f6e7a75f856fc053b58b35b5148edf5df8eab447af4c47e2R148-R152)`)

PR #763: update authz check

Description:
This pull request updates the `account_info.go` file in the `package graph` to improve authorization checks and streamline imports. The changes replace a deprecated authorization method with a more robust approach and refine the list of imported packages.

### Authorization Improvements:
* Replaced `http.TokenIsMachine(ctx)` with `authz.Check(ctx, authz.AssertCallerIsOtherService())` to enhance authorization logic. This ensures that the caller is verified as another service using a more modern and reliable method.

### Import Refinements:
* Removed the unused `github.com/ConsultingMD/go-common/http` package and added the `github.com/ConsultingMD/go-common/app/auth/authz` package to align with the updated authorization logic.

### Authorization improvements:
* Replaced the `http.TokenIsMachine` check with `authz.Check` to enforce service-to-service authorization using `authz.AssertCallerIsOtherService`. This change enhances security by ensuring proper validation of machine tokens.

### Import updates:
* Added the `auth/authz` package to the import statements and removed the `http` package, aligning with the new authorization approach.

Description:
This pull request introduces updates to the authentication logic in the `schema.resolvers.go` file and upgrades dependencies in `go.mod`. The authentication changes replace token-based checks with a more robust role-based authorization mechanism, while the dependency updates improve compatibility and incorporate newer versions of libraries.

### Authentication Updates
* **Enhanced Authorization Logic**: Replaced token-based checks (`http.TokenIsUser` and `http.TokenIsMachine`) with role-based authorization using `authz.Check`. This ensures better control over access by asserting caller roles (`AssertCallerIsOtherService`, `AssertCallerIsMember`) and combining them with logical operators (`authz.Or`).

### Dependency Updates
* **Go Version Upgrade**: Updated Go version from `1.23.8` to `1.24.2` and toolchain from `go1.23.9` to `go1.24.4`.
* **Library Updates**: Upgraded multiple dependencies in `go.mod`, including `github.com/ConsultingMD/go-common` (v1.163.0 → v1.166.0), `go.opentelemetry.io/otel` (v1.35.0 → v1.36.0), and `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9` (v9.7.3 → v9.10.0), among others, for improved functionality and compatibility.

PR #252: misc refactors to account creation cmds + adding cmd to generate hash from member demographics

Description:
This pull request introduces several enhancements and new features to the `ais` and `hub` services, focusing on improved account creation, demographic hashing, and handling of primary account fields. It also includes updates to GraphQL queries and command-line interfaces for better flexibility and usability. Below are the most significant changes grouped by theme.

### Enhancements to Account Handling
* Added support for handling primary account fields in both `create_account` and `get_account_ids` methods by introducing a `primaries` flag. This affects the logic for processing input/output CSVs and field prefixes. (`lib/service/ais.py`, `lib/service/hub.py`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a218dbae248f86e7e3c904b8fb82bdbe9dabc106e81bff11e0b63f8f068ab4b0R134-R167) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-cb7fe3ef43b3bc5893f15a942c124bba0649eebf11628fc5ffb95e56700c6465L47-R64)
* Updated the `build_mutation_variables` method to dynamically handle optional fields and validate required fields, returning an `invalid_row` flag for incomplete data. (`lib/service/ais.py`)

### New Features
* Introduced a `generate_demographic_hash` method to create a SHA256 hash from normalized demographic data (first name, last name, DOB, and SSN last 4 digits). This method is also exposed via a new CLI command. (`lib/service/ais.py`, `tool/service.py`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a218dbae248f86e7e3c904b8fb82bdbe9dabc106e81bff11e0b63f8f068ab4b0R96-R124) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-4e3aca18cafec57820f7cd50f3410267afa253aec13c8ddb7b7181bd7fb160bfR114-R128)
* Added CLI options for specifying the `primaries` flag in `create_account` and `get_account_ids` commands, improving command-line flexibility. (`tool/service.py`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-4e3aca18cafec57820f7cd50f3410267afa253aec13c8ddb7b7181bd7fb160bfR114-R128) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-4e3aca18cafec57820f7cd50f3410267afa253aec13c8ddb7b7181bd7fb160bfR1092-R1096)

### GraphQL Query Updates
* Extended GraphQL queries to include additional fields such as `phone` for accounts and `firstName`/`lastName` for relationships. (`lib/service/ais.py`, `lib/service/relationship.py`) [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a218dbae248f86e7e3c904b8fb82bdbe9dabc106e81bff11e0b63f8f068ab4b0R32) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-5e97f4de049f0892c23f0a1ddf87bc3ef1051811f70bc49528092d1aa5fcc455R14-R20)

### Minor Improvements
* Refactored the `create_account` method to handle account existence checks more robustly by introducing a constant for the `ACCOUNT_ALREADY_EXISTS` status. (`lib/service/ais.py`)
* Adjusted the default value for the `provenances` option in the `relationship` command to an empty list for better flexibility. (`tool/service.py`)

PR #944: fix blocked-demographics-list-json FF declaration

Description:
This pull request introduces changes to enhance the handling of blocked demographics in account creation, refactor feature flag usage, and improve test coverage. The most significant updates include replacing string-based feature flags with JSON-based ones, adding a utility function for parsing blocked demographics, and updating the test suite to align with these changes.

### Enhancements to blocked demographics handling:
* Replaced `BlockedDemographicsList` feature flag type from `StringFeatureFlagger` to `JSONFeatureFlagger` in `protostoreRepository` and updated its usage to parse JSON directly into a slice of strings. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fL97-R101) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fL127-R131)
* Added a new method `getBlockedDemographicsList` to encapsulate the logic for parsing the blocked demographics list from the feature flag, improving code readability and error handling. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository.goR674-R683](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR674-R683))

### Refactoring feature flag usage:
* Refactored `checkAndBlockDemographics` to use the new `getBlockedDemographicsList` method, removing inline JSON parsing logic and improving error handling. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository.goL680-R695](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fL680-R695))
* Added telemetry logging to provide better insights into the generated demographic hashes during account creation. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository.goR721-R722](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR721-R722))

### Test suite improvements:
* Updated `ProtostoreRepositoryConfig` in tests to use a `[]string` type for `BlockedDemographicsList` instead of a JSON string, aligning with the new implementation. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.goL70-R71](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96L70-R71))
* Enhanced the mock feature flag implementation to populate target structs with blocked demographics data, ensuring test flexibility and accuracy. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.goL85-R100](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96L85-R100))
* Modified test cases to reflect the new feature flag structure and removed tests for invalid JSON handling, as the new implementation no longer requires manual JSON parsing. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository_test.go`, [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96L1382-R1397) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96L1420-R1435) [[3]](diffhunk://#diff-3ff897f9a97ac6cd650d9cacb0140cabd771393450e0fef0ecfffcc1055f2b96L1438-R1462)

PR #943: [ACQ-1251] add support to block account creation based on specific demographic data

Description:
Ticket: https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/ACQ-1251

This pull request introduces a new feature to block account creation based on demographic data, along with supporting utility methods, feature flags, and comprehensive tests. The most important changes include adding a demographic hash-based blocking mechanism, introducing new feature flags, implementing a utility for generating demographic hashes, and expanding test coverage.

### New Feature: Demographic-Based Account Blocking
* Added `checkAndBlockDemographics` method to `protostoreRepository` to block account creation if demographic data matches a restricted hash, controlled by a feature flag. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository.goR670-R737](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR670-R737))
* Introduced a new error type `ErrAccountCreationBlockedDemographics` to signal blocked account creation attempts. (`app/repository/errors.go`, [app/repository/errors.goR42-R43](diffhunk://#diff-00604b0ead13b76933d158e4c6f97ec68aca3ed67137e0ab2c39fa772f9da4ddR42-R43))

### Feature Flags and Configuration
* Added feature flags `enable-demographic-based-account-blocking` and `blocked-demographics-list-json` for enabling the blocking mechanism and defining restricted hashes. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [app/repository/protostore_account_repository.goR49-R50](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR49-R50))
* Updated `protostoreRepository` to fetch these feature flags during initialization. (`app/repository/protostore_account_repository.go`, [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR96-R97) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR126-R127)

### Utility Method for Demographic Hashing
* Added `GenerateDemographicHash` utility to create SHA256 hashes from normalized demographic data for comparison against the restricted list. (`app/utils/demographic_hasher.go`, [app/utils/demographic_hasher.goR1-R53](diffhunk://#diff-ae999600e052be635aa2711c139f0ff13f3ae1b09b75dc36ab625cda7c785e1aR1-R53))

### Test Coverage
* Added unit tests for `checkAndBlockDemographics` and integration tests for account creation scenarios with demographic blocking enabled or disabled.

PR #70: fix CD

Description:
This should fix CD.

This pull request includes updates to configuration files that enhance pre-commit hooks and streamline CI/CD processes. The most important changes involve upgrading a dependency version, adding new pre-commit hooks, and simplifying continuous deployment checks.

### Pre-commit configuration updates:
* [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](diffhunk://#diff-63a9c44a44acf85fea213a857769990937107cf072831e1a26808cfde9d096b9L14-R22): Upgraded the `image-builder` repository dependency from `v2.2.6` to `v2.2.8` and added two new hooks: `validate-codecov` and `tng-config-validate`.

### Continuous deployment configuration updates:
* [`platform/serviceConfig.yaml`](diffhunk://#diff-b4d680b3fbd7cc568486043db42c3407e6e0abc36b326e59c20c5331d3b9128bL48-R49): Simplified the `continuousDeployment.checks` list by replacing `build_node` and `build_tng` with a single `build` check. The other commands were copied from a separate service and don't exist here, so it never executed.

PR #48: DIH retail user registration

Description:
This pull request introduces a new end-to-end test for creating a retail user account in the `DIH Member App` and includes a minor improvement to an existing test. The new test covers the entire signup flow, from account creation to verifying homepage elements, while the existing test is updated to include a timeout for better reliability.

### New Test Addition:
* **New Test Implementation**: Added a comprehensive end-to-end test for retail user account creation in `src/apps/mx-app/tests/create-account-retail-user-dih.spec.ts`. This includes steps for navigation, signup, personal information entry, insurance selection, SSN verification, demographics questionnaire, and homepage validation. The test also integrates with TestRail for annotations and screenshots on failure.

### Existing Test Update:
* **Timeout Addition**: Updated the existing retail user account creation test in `src/apps/mx-app/tests/create-account-retail-user.spec.ts` to add a 15-second timeout for verifying the visibility of the "Welcome to Included Health" heading. This improves test stability.

PR #61: [IAM-441] [Acquire] - Implement DIH branding in relevant screens

Description:
This pull request introduces a significant enhancement to the application's handling of the `isDih` state, which determines whether the app is in "Doctor on Demand" mode. The changes focus on improving state management, ensuring consistency across server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR), and integrating the `isDih` state into various components. The most important changes are grouped into state management, component updates, and utility improvements.

### State Management Enhancements:
* Added a new `AppContext` in `src/shared/contexts/AppContext.tsx` to provide a centralized context for managing the `isDih` state across the application. The context includes methods to initialize, update, and persist the state using URL parameters and `localStorage`.
* Updated `pages/_app.tsx` to wrap the application in the `AppProvider` context and added logic to handle SSR and CSR scenarios for determining the `isDih` state.

### Component Updates:
* Modified `Navbar` in `src/shared/components/navbar.tsx` to dynamically select the appropriate logo based on the `isDih` state, with fallback mechanisms to handle missing context or URL parameters. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-959399c769cbb04bcd8fdc3c84bb1ca61ba03a0ac6c0e0d7b58c34ba7accb11fL1-L7) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-959399c769cbb04bcd8fdc3c84bb1ca61ba03a0ac6c0e0d7b58c34ba7accb11fL17-R63) [[3]](diffhunk://#diff-959399c769cbb04bcd8fdc3c84bb1ca61ba03a0ac6c0e0d7b58c34ba7accb11fL29-R73)
* Updated `pages/login.tsx` to use the `useAppContext` hook for accessing and updating the `isDih` state, ensuring consistency between URL parameters and context. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-efe206089575e5aa92a4bacded0c0c25b4ef6b11199e0d8620eecd1d65b66f50R22) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-efe206089575e5aa92a4bacded0c0c25b4ef6b11199e0d8620eecd1d65b66f50R35-R64)

### Utility Improvements:
* Enhanced `getAmplitudeEventProperties` in `src/lib/services/ampli/utils.ts` to accept an optional `contextOrAppParamIsDih` parameter, allowing it to prioritize context or URL parameters when determining the `isDih` state.
* Updated `useFlow` in `src/shared/hooks/useFlow.ts` to preserve the `app` parameter during flow creation, ensuring that the `isDih` state is consistently propagated during navigation.

Description:
Per Slack thread: https://ih-epdd.slack.com/archives/C07UYHBAJ7M/p1746464456102269

This pull request simplifies the authentication logic in the `MxApp` component by removing the `AuthzillaVsAuth0Wrapper` and replacing it with a direct implementation using the `Auth0Provider`. Additionally, it removes unused imports and feature flags related to the deprecated `Authzilla` functionality.

### Authentication Refactor:
* Removed the `AuthzillaVsAuth0Wrapper` component and replaced it with a direct implementation of `Auth0Provider` in the `MxApp` component. This change simplifies the code and removes reliance on the `LaunchDarkly` feature flag for determining the authentication tenant.

* Removed the `isDomainGrandrounds` state and its associated logic from `MxApp`, as it is no longer needed after the refactor. (`[pages/_app.tsxL151](diffhunk://#diff-a9827ce1be32c607c948881a89b99c592f752898f9c49e0dea0b7199eb151029L151)`)

PR #936: [ACQ-1217] [Acquire] - Create separate FF for ChangeEmail 

Description:
This pull request refactors the `protostore_account_repository` to improve clarity and extend functionality for identity synchronization. The key changes include renaming a helper function for better readability, introducing a new feature flag for email change synchronization, and updating test cases to align with the new naming and functionality.

### Refactoring and Feature Enhancements:

* Renamed the helper function `syncToAuthzilla` to `shouldCallAuthzilla` for better clarity and updated its parameters to accept specific identity synchronization flags. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fL296-R304) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fL308-R323)
* Added a new feature flag `identitySyncEmailChange` to support synchronization of email changes to Authzilla. This flag is now used in relevant methods such as `mergeAccounts`.

### Updates to Repository Logic:

* Replaced the `syncToAuthzilla` flag with `identitySyncLinking` and `identitySyncEmailChange` in the `protostoreRepository` struct and all associated logic.

### Logging Improvements:

* Added detailed logging to the `mergeAccounts` method to provide better traceability for actions like linking autogenerated accounts and updating emails in Authzilla. [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR507-R508) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-31d6a460dc5d4efc70545d249248f96bfef85e9e93c5b73a7708da24238cc53fR520-R529)

### Test Suite Updates:

* Updated the test suite to reflect the renaming of `syncToAuthzilla` to `identitySyncLinking` and added support for testing `identitySyncEmailChange`.

Mitigation for [INC-730](https://includedhealth.atlassian.net/browse/INC-730)

This pull request introduces several significant changes to the account enrollment handling and related functionality. The main updates include adding a feature flag to disable patient creation for auto-generated accounts, enhancing the account enrollment handler to respect this flag, and updating the corresponding tests to cover new scenarios.

### Enhancements to Account Enrollment Handling:

* **Feature Flag Implementation**:
  * Added a new feature flag `DisablePatientCreationForAutoGeneratedAccountEnrollmentEvent` to control whether patient creation should be disabled for auto-generated accounts (`app/model/feature_flags.go`, `app/model/module.go`). [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-f8226ebe6611e912f914bfb12ced8a3e93bc2db1a1b3b20540496b5240195449R110-R118) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-cb8ef8fae6e81e8d5d2e419e11f30bd75d064187ce80592c4df077889bd5ec0cR24)

* **Account Enrollment Handler Updates**:
  * Introduced a new method `shouldIgnore` to determine if an account enrollment event should be ignored based on the account's email, mitigating duplicate account issues (`app/handler/event/account_enrollment.go`).
  * Updated the `Handle` method to use this new logic and added the feature flag check (`app/handler/event/account_enrollment.go`).

* **Service Enhancements**:
  * Added a `GetAccount` method to the enrollment service to retrieve account details (`app/service/enrollment/service.go`).
  * Updated the service initialization to include the account gateway (`app/service/enrollment/service.go`). [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-ae9f22e2c6dd3ce0700737bd9acd83c23b50a159f138ec55fdd1cc9b3c0cb66eR32-R53) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-ae9f22e2c6dd3ce0700737bd9acd83c23b50a159f138ec55fdd1cc9b3c0cb66eR9-R13)

### Test Coverage Improvements:

* **New Test Cases**:
  * Added test cases to cover scenarios where the account is auto-generated and should be ignored during enrollment processing (`app/handler/event/account_enrollment_test.go`). [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-090f1e7e1a6bdfa0b65ec7df9ba2dc8991bba971866e80570e3936c779415d9cR38-R88) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-090f1e7e1a6bdfa0b65ec7df9ba2dc8991bba971866e80570e3936c779415d9cR97-R120)

### Miscellaneous Fixes and Improvements:

* **Typo Fix**:
  * Corrected a typo in the log message from "skippng" to "skipping" (`app/handler/event/account_change.go`).

* **Imports and Package Updates**:
  * Organized imports and added missing dependencies in various files (`app/handler/event/account_enrollment.go`, `app/service/enrollment/module.go`, `app/service/enrollment/service.go`). [[1]](diffhunk://#diff-a828da04c2b2d197c9085d332f8abe823431532c3bdd71112648ff0ce26bb216R5-R22) [[2]](diffhunk://#diff-62077ad32d1bc6666be3b62c9a04333e2d55836f3ea2b21a7af47f66390f415cL3-R5) [[3]](diffhunk://#diff-ae9f22e2c6dd3ce0700737bd9acd83c23b50a159f138ec55fdd1cc9b3c0cb66eR9-R13)
  * Added a placeholder package for mocks in the diagnostics service (`app/service/diagnostics/mocks/package.go`).

These changes collectively improve the robustness of the account enrollment process by addressing potential issues with auto-generated accounts and enhancing the test coverage to ensure reliability.
